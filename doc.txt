Created git commit.

Success! Created reactprojects at C:\reactprojects
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd reactprojects
  npm start
Compiled successfully!

You can now view reactprojects in the browser.   

  Local:            http://localhost:3000        
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.49.1:3000     

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
